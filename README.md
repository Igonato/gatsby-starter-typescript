# Gatsby Starter TypeScript

Minimalistic starter with only essential boilerplate. No UI frameworks.

Based on the [Igonato/gatsby-starter-hello-world-typescript][0] bare-bones
starter that has:

-   Added `typescript` and `typescript-plugin-css-modules` as dependencies
-   Added tsconfig.json
-   Added `type-check` npm script and type declarations for css modules
-   Added basic 404 page
-   Page files converted to .tsx
-   Added `"tabWidth": 4` in `.prettierrc` since 4-space tabs seem to be
    more common amongst the TypeScript crowd.

This starter adds:

-   `gatsby-plugin-image` and supporting plugins
-   `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet` and basic site metadata
    (perfect score in Lighthouse. Yay! ðŸŽ‰)
-   Basic header-main-footer layout
-   Couple more pages and a navbar
-   CSS normalize and some basic styles
-   Simple dark/lite theming with switching support.
